## The Additional Extensions (*GLM_EXT2*)

The [Additional Extensions](https://github.com/ChrdevzZ/glm/tree/master/glm/ext2) is an additional extension of GLM in [this repository](https://github.com/ChrdevzZ/glm) which has the prefix name *GLM_EXT2_* in the `glm/ext2/`. The added header files for the additional extensions are set into the glm/ext2/ directory. Note that <glm/ext.hpp> includes all of these additional extensions, and you need to define a macro named `GLM_ENABLE_ADDITIONAL_EXTENSIONS` when using them.
